Support Vector Classification (SVC)

Overview

Support Vector Classification (SVC) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in a dataset.

Features

Supports both linear and non-linear classification.

Uses kernel functions (Linear, Polynomial, RBF, Sigmoid) to map input features into higher-dimensional spaces.

Effective in high-dimensional spaces.

Regularization parameter (C) to control overfitting.
